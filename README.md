# Stress_Detector 


# Aim: 
Project to develop a live Stress Detection API using Deep Learning, CNN and Flask 

# Dataset:
  Keras FER2013 dataset

# Libraries Required:
  1. Keras
  2. OpenCV
  3. Dlib
  4.imutils
  5. Flask
  
# Resources:
  68 Point Facial Landmark
# Procedure:
  1. Emotion Recongition- model training 
  2. Getting Vieos frame-by-frame using OpenCV
  3. Calculation stress levels using eyebrow and lip movements
  4. Displayng calculated stress levels continously on the frame
  5. Deploying the Ap using Flask in Python
 
 # Working:
  Clone and download the repository and run the app.py file and view the output in the local server page.
